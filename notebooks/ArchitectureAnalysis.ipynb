    "We can formulate detoxification task as text-to-text translation, or to be more precise sequence-to-sequence (because languages is a sequences of words/text). And now it is pretty easy to understand that we are working with translation task. One of the most popular architecture for seq-to-seq tasks is transformers.\n",

    "Transformers is a subclass of neural network which solves a problem of Sequence Transduction (machine translation). Transformets are gaining popularity as they solve variety of tasks related to sequences (such as text/speech related problems). Such neural network models are based on idea of memory: recurrent layers, memory cells. It is also a common thing to see some kind of importance and attention to highlight key parts model should be focused on.\n",

It is also worth mentionaning, that this session helped to identify good practices that could be also considered, such as using `GELU` or `ReLU` activation functions, basing our solution on `LSTM` layers, and using dropout with rate close to `0.1`"
